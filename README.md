### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Saikrishna - a computer science engineering student with a passion for building projects and exploring new technologies. My diverse skill set includes proficiency in multiple programming languages, such as C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, Bash, and Python.

I love contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with other developers to build impactful applications. My interests include full-stack development, web development, and data-driven applications. I'm always on the lookout for new tools and technologies to add to my toolkit, and I enjoy participating in hackathons and coding challenges to keep my skills sharp.

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading about the latest trends in tech or working on personal projects. I value communication, collaboration, and diversity in tech, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and learn from others.

Feel free to check out my GitHub profile to see some of my work and projects.
